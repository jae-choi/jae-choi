# Hi there 👋  

I use this space to share the latest AI and data trends — not just what’s new, but why it matters.  
Working at the intersection of tech and philosophy, I explore how GenAI, multi-agent systems, and applied ML are changing the way we think, build, and decide.  
You’ll find curated insights, practical ideas, and updates worth thinking about.
