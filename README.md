Hi there 👋

I use this space to share the latest AI and data trends — not just what’s new, but why it matters.

Working at the intersection of tech and philosophy, I explore how GenAI, multi-agent systems, and applied ML are changing the way we think, build, and decide. You’ll find curated insights, practical ideas, and updates worth thinking about.

Selected Work & Analysis
  * [Interactive Report] The Future of Work with Google Agentspace
    * A visual deconstruction of enterprise AI platforms, turning a dense business proposal into an intuitive,
      explorable web application.
