Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I use this space to share the latest AI and data trends â€” not just whatâ€™s new, but why it matters.

Working at the intersection of tech and philosophy, I explore how GenAI, multi-agent systems, and applied ML are changing the way we think, build, and decide. Youâ€™ll find curated insights, practical ideas, and updates worth thinking about.
